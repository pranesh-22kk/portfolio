# Alternative Email Setup Options

## Option 1: Fix Gmail API Issue

### Step 1: Reset Gmail Service
1. Go to EmailJS dashboard
2. Delete existing Gmail service
3. Add new Gmail service
4. **IMPORTANT**: When authorizing, make sure to:
   - Click "Advanced" if you see a security warning
   - Click "Go to EmailJS (unsafe)" 
   - Grant ALL permissions requested

### Step 2: Check Gmail Settings
1. Go to your Gmail account settings
2. Enable "Less secure app access" (if available)
3. Or use App Passwords for 2FA accounts

## Option 2: Use Outlook/Hotmail Instead

1. In EmailJS, choose "Outlook" instead of Gmail
2. Use your Microsoft account to authorize
3. Often works better than Gmail for API access

## Option 3: Use Web3Forms (Alternative Service)

If EmailJS continues to have issues, we can switch to Web3Forms:

1. Go to https://web3forms.com/
2. Sign up for free
3. Get your access key
4. No OAuth required - simpler setup

## Option 4: Formspree (Another Alternative)

1. Go to https://formspree.io/
2. Create account
3. Create a form endpoint
4. Works without complex authentication

## Quick Test Solution

For now, your contact form will:
- ✅ Show success message to users
- ✅ Log all form data to console (F12 → Console)
- ✅ Provide your direct email for contact
- ❌ Won't send automatic emails until service is fixed

## Recommendation

Try Option 1 (reset Gmail service) first. If that doesn't work, let's switch to Web3Forms - it's much simpler and more reliable.
